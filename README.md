## Hi everyone, it's me, Consuelo, walking towards the exciting world of programming  ðŸ‘‹
##### I love dogs, cats (animals in general) and, of course, videogames and robotics!
Probably one of the biggest interest dicovered on my way out from university is programming. I'm Mechanical Engineer for career, but with `python` in the heart, and other languages like `Dart`, `R` or `C++` for obligation.
