## Hi everyone, it's me, Consuelo, walking towards the exciting world of programming  ðŸ‘‹
##### I love dogs, cats (animals in general) and, of course, videogames and robotics!
Probably one of the biggest interest dicovered on my way out of university is programming. I'm a Mechanical Engineer for career, but with `python` in the heart, and other languages like `Dart`, `R` or `C++` for obligation.
